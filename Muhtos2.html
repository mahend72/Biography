        <div class="body-text">
		<p>The MUTHOS has achieved significant milestones in identifying emerging technologies. One notable accomplishment includes the identification of a robust Data Source containing a substantial volume of scientific and multi-disciplinary documents related to cutting-edge technologies. Additionally, we have successfully employed specialized tools, particularly BERTopic, to extract and analyze emerging topics and trends from these documents. Furthermore, developing a comprehensive evaluation strategy featuring automation for the precise assessment of emerging technology documents marks a significant advancement in our approach.
         These achievements underscore the effectiveness and innovation of our methodology in identifying and understanding emerging technologies within the MUTHOS project. The insights gained from this research pave the way for advancements in technology assessment, providing valuable contributions to identifying and analysing emerging trends, breakthroughs, and innovations in various domains.</p>

              <p>The Semantic Enhanced Topic Network is a powerful tool that combines semantic analysis with network representation to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relationships between topics within a corpus of text data. Unlike other topic modeling techniques, such as LDA and NMF, which only identify topics based on word co-occurrence within documents, the Semantic Enhanced Topic Network uses advanced semantic analysis techniques, often utilizing pre-trained language models like BERT. These language models can accurately understand the context and meaning of words within the document, resulting in a more nuanced representation of topics.</p>

              <img src="./assets/images/evol.png" class="gallery-image">
              <p>The Evolutionary Topic Network facilitates identifying and comprehending emerging technologies within a dynamic text corpus. This approach is achieved by integrating topic modelling and temporal analysis to enable researchers to examine the trajectory of emerging topics, monitor shifts in technology discussions, and gain valuable insights into the evolution of new technologies over time.  The Evolutionary Topic Network allows researchers to recognise emerging trends and innovations, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of the continuous advancement of technology in our ever-changing world. This innovative approach is a valuable tool for technology assessment and foresight, as it can reveal the emergence and development of new technologies, thereby aiding in identifying and analysing breakthroughs and trends that shape the future technological landscape. In essence, the Evolutionary Topic Network is a crucial tool for researchers and professionals working in the technology industry. By utilising this approach, they can stay ahead of the curve, gain valuable insights, and make informed decisions to drive progress and innovation in the field. As such, the Evolutionary Topic Network is an indispensable tool that can help shape the future of technology and drive technological progress for years to come.</p>

              <p>The Modified Clique Percolation Method (M-CPM) is an advanced network analysis tool for community detection in complex evolutionary networks. Its primary goal is to identify overlapping communities or clusters within a network.

By leveraging the M-CPM algorithm, researchers can analyze and study how communities evolve and change over time in dynamic networks. The method allows nodes to belong to multiple communities simultaneously, accommodating the inherent overlapping nature of many real-world networks.

With the ability to identify overlapping communities, the M-CPM provides a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationships between nodes, unveiling hidden patterns and connections that might not be apparent through traditional community detection methods.</p>
